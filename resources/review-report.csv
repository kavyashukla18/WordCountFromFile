8/5/2019 18:28,This logic is not required as it is already handled in enableConsent() which is present in SonicareConsentManager.java
8/6/2019 12:18,Optimize  this code
8/6/2019 12:26,Replace this logic by using feature provider API isLivebrushingSupported()
8/6/2019 13:37,This logic looks wrong as part of wrong consent implementation. Let’s discuss.
8/6/2019 14:58,
8/6/2019 16:21,"Replace this by featureProvider's isLivaBrushingSupported API.
Also move this logic to initView function."
8/6/2019 16:31,Why this logic was moved from onStart() ? Any specific reason.
8/6/2019 16:33,"As these two buttons are always enabled. make it enabled in xml if disabled.
If in xml already enabled then remove calling setEnabled."
8/6/2019 16:43,Do not think this is required. For new oslo and  Osaka user the consent state will be rejected instead of inactive.
8/6/2019 16:48,
8/6/2019 16:57,For me : verify getDeviceToFilterConsent logic
8/6/2019 17:07,"If personal consent fetch happens before mouthrins and tongiueclean below scenario will fail.

A shanghai user who has rejected personal consent. If he on-boards Shanghai device again mouthrinse and tongueclean consent will be shown to him which is wrong."
8/6/2019 17:08,Instead of popBackStack use onBackPressed.
8/7/2019 13:36,Both are same. Why you want to go through fragment manager when your activity can do the work.
8/6/2019 18:08,Rename variable b to isChecked
8/6/2019 18:22,"Disabling personal consent will disable MouthRins and TongueClean consent.
Check the behaviour with iOS. As per the requirement MouthRins and TongueClean should retain their state."
8/6/2019 18:48,Use UtilityAppContext.getContext()
8/6/2019 18:48,Use UtilityAppContext.getContext()
8/6/2019 18:49,change this import to import static com.philips.cdp.ohc.utility.UtilityAppContext
8/6/2019 19:12,This sting was added for OSAKA firmware upgrade. Please check and revert it.
8/6/2019 19:13,This sting was added for OSAKA firmware upgrade. Please check and revert it.
8/7/2019 15:21,Remove this. This will have side effect on  add device flow.
8/7/2019 15:22,This logic is wrong. Please revert
8/7/2019 15:23,Lets discuss with iOS team and change

6/12/2019 11:04,"compareToIgnoreCase method compares two strings. If we are comparing two versions such as ""2.2.1"" with ""2.11.1"" this api fails because digit after first dot are 2 and 1 in this case 2 is grater than 1 hence result will be ""2.2.1"" > ""2.11.1"" which is not expected. Hence compareVersions() api is added to perform version comparison."
